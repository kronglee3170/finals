		<h2>Founded in 1946, in Brooklyn, New York</h2>
			<p>Cosmic Fitness was founded in 1946 in Brooklyn, New York, as a space where people from different backgrounds and stories come together 
			with one goal - staying healthy.</p>
			<p>Established just after World War II, Cosmic Fitness started as a small local gym aimed at helping
			returning veterans regain their strength and well-being. Over the decades, it has become a stable of the community, welcoming individuals
			from all walks of life.</p>
			<p>From humble beginnings with simple weights and training equipment, Cosmic Fitness has grown into a modern fitness
			facility that blends history and innovation. We pride ourselves on creating a space where inclusivity, health, and community meet. Today,
			Cosmic Fitness stands as a testament to the belief that fitness is for everyone, regardless of age, gender, or experience. Our mission 
			has been the same since day one: to empower people to achieve their fitness goals in a supportive and welcoming environment.</p>
